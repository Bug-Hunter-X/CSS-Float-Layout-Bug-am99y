The following CSS code causes an unexpected layout issue in certain browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

The issue arises because the `float` property can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior in the layout engine if the parent element is not properly cleared. This can cause the elements to overlap or render unexpectedly.
